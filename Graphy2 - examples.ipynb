    "- interquartile range (the black bar in the center of violin)\n",
    "- the lower/upper adjacent values (the black lines stretched from the bar) — defined as first quartile — 1.5 IQR and third quartile + 1.5 IQR respectively. These values can be used in a simple outlier detection technique (Tukey’s fences) — observations lying outside of these “fences” can be considered outliers.\n",
